    Perform Poisson rate encoding on the input signal.

    This function supports both numpy arrays and PyTorch tensors as input. It generates a spike train using a Poisson
    distribution, where the probability of emitting a spike in a given interval is determined by the normalized rate
    of the signal.

    **Algorithm Details**:

    Poisson rate encoding is a type of rate coding used in neural networks to convert continuous signals into spike
    trains. The Poisson process is a stochastic process that models the occurrence of events (spikes) that are
    independent of one another and occur with a certain rate over time.

    The probability of observing `n` spikes in a time interval `Î”t` is given by the Poisson distribution formula:

    **Usage**::

        import numpy as np
        try:
            import torch
        except ImportError:
            torch = None  # In case torch is not installed

        # Example with numpy array
        signal = np.array([0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0])
        interval_length = 2
        encoded_signal = poisson_rate(signal, interval_length)

        # Example with PyTorch tensor
        if torch:
            signal_tensor = torch.tensor([0.2, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0])
            encoded_signal_tensor = poisson_rate(signal_tensor, interval)

    :param signal: The input signal to be encoded. This can be either a numpy ndarray or a torch Tensor.
    :type signal: numpy.ndarray
    :param interval_length: The size of the interval for encoding the spike train.
    :type interval_length: int
    :return: A 1D array or tensor of encoded spike data after Poisson rate encoding.
    :rtype: numpy.ndarray
    :raises ValueError: If the input signal is empty.
    :raises ValueError: If the interval is not a multiple of the signal length.
    :raises TypeError: If the signal is not a numpy ndarray
