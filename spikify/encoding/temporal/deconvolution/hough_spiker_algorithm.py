    """
    Perform spike detection using the Hough Spiker Algorithm (HSA).

    This function detects spikes in an input signal by performing a progressive subtraction operation,
    where the signal is compared with a convolution result using a boxcar filter. If the signal value
    exceeds the filter result, the signal is modified by subtracting the filter, and a spike is recorded.

    Refer to the :ref:`hough_spiker_algorithm_desc` for a detailed explanation of the HSA.

    **Code Example**
