================================================================

The ``latency`` folder contains algorithms that encode information based on the timing between spikes, known as the inter-spike interval (ISI). This approach leverages the temporal dynamics of spike trains, particularly when bursts of spikes are involved, to enhance the reliability and efficiency of neural communication.

Contents of the ``latency`` folder:

- **Burst Encoding**: A method that encodes information using the timing and intervals between multiple spikes in a burst, improving the accuracy of signal transmission.

Below, you will find links to the specific modules for each latency coding algorithm:
