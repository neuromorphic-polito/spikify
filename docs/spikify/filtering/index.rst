Filtering
=========

The **filtering** module in the **spikify** library is designed to mimic natural filtering mechanisms found in biological systems, offering advanced pre-processing techniques for time-varying signals.

Filtering Techniques
---------------------

In **spikify**, the filtering approach includes:

- **Frequency Decomposition**: The filtering techniques break down time-varying signals into multiple frequency components.
- **Advanced Filters**: Techniques such as Gammatone and Butterworth filters are used to split the signal into different channels, each corresponding to a specific frequency range.

.. note::

    The **filtering** module is currently under development and will be released in the upcoming version of the **spikify** library. Stay tuned for updates on the release schedule and new features.
