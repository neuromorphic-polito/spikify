Rate Coding
===========

Widely adopted for artificial neural networks (ANNs) due to its ease and robustness, **Rate Coding** employs a mechanism for information representation based on the number of spikes per unit time. This approach allows for a straightforward and effective way to encode the intensity of a signal by varying the spike frequency.

Below, you will find links to the specific description for the rate coding method:
