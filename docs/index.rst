Inspiration
------------

The **spikify**  library is inspired by the research presented in the paper `Spike encoding techniques for IoT time-varying signals benchmarked on a neuromorphic classification task <https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fnins.2022.999029/full>`_, which explores various methods for converting continuous signals into spike-based representations for neuromorphic computing.
